            <h2>iEnergy <small> a monitoring system</small></h2>
        </div>
        <p> The <b>iEnergy</b> project was born as a consequence of the projects Jeerp and Applus. The main goal is to have an open source platform able to monitor and manage energetic data in different kind of buildings.</p>
        <p> IEnergy offers a solid basis to implement any enterprise product for an integrated management for the home and building automation. </p>
        <p> The main feature of iEnergy is the ability to collect electric/energetic/climatic measures coming from a building. The collection is done through the sematic gateway DOG which enables the access to any field technology.</p>
        <p> A problem that the system faced is the storage of a huge amount of data, that are several millions per year. In fact, a small building can produce up to 1000 records per minute. Hence, it is necessary to have a system able to collect, store and manage this information. It is alaso possible to create reports in order to do other analysis.</p>
        <p> The system doesn't have a built-in graphic interface, but it makes available some API REST/JSON that can be used in any kind of applicatio such as visualization or analysis interface exploting storing and filtering functions.</p>
        <p> Other features are the collection of users' opinion about climatic conditions of the building. According to their opinion, it is possible to "correct" the settings of of the cooling system</p>
